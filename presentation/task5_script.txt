Task 5 : Campaign Effectiveness (16 Marks) 

I worked with cleaned_post_data, cleaned_engagement, and cleaned_campaign_data.

First, I extracted Campaign Name, Likes, Impressions, and Clicks into campaign_performance.

Then I created a pivot table named campaign_metric_summary
using Campaign Name with total and average of Likes, Impressions, and Clicks.

This gives total and average performance for each campaign.

Next, I added a new column campaign_phase in cleaned post data to mark posts as Before Campaign or During Campaign.

Then I created a pivot table using Likes, Clicks, Impressions, and Campaign Phase shows campaign_uplift

This shows the engagement uplift during the campaign compared to before.


After that, I performed ROI analysis.
Here, I calculated total engagement divided by ad spend for each campaign.
From this analysis, DailyWellness campaign has the highest ROI.

as we have already performed unfollower is subtracted from new followers to find out what is the net followers growth . then 
I have created a pivot table using Campaign Name and Net Follower Growth.

From this pivot table , DailyWellness campaign has the strongest follower growth impact.
