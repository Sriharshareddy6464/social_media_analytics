Task 1 – Data Cleaning & Preparation (Presentation Script)

For Task 1, I worked with the raw dataset provided.

First, I reviewed the entire dataset to understand the structure and identify issues.
I noticed inconsistent naming, mixed data types, missing values, and unstructured hashtags.

Then, I cleaned the data by:

standardizing platform names

correcting content type labels

fixing numeric columns like likes, comments, impressions, and clicks

After that, I structured the hashtag column to make it consistent and usable for analysis.
I also removed unnecessary spaces and formatting issues.

Once cleaning was completed, I saved the dataset as cleaned data for further tasks.

From this task, I learned the importance of data quality before analysis.
I understood that even small inconsistencies can affect results.

This task helped me build a strong foundation for all further analysis.
