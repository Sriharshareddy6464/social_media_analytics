Task 3: Social Media Platform analysis 

here I have analysed dataset 

I have created pivot table to figure out the highest engagement rate , Instagram generates the highest engagement rate 


I have subtracted unfollowers from the new follower to get the net follower growth , based on the net follower growth I have created another pivot table this determines the highest growth rates of followers across different platform , Instagram is the highest growth rate

I have create a scatter chart to represent the visualisation of adspends and engagement rate across all platforms 


my advice Based on:
- high engagement on Instagram
- strong growth on Instagram
- and consistent performance from Facebook

I suggest focusing on 1–2 core platforms: Instagram and Facebook.

These platforms give better results compared to others.
So instead of spreading across all platforms,
it is better to concentrate on Instagram and Facebook.
