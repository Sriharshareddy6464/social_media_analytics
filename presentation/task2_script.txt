I used the Posts sheet from dataset for Engagement Analysis

First, I started calculation process for engagement rate for each post to do the implementation 

here I performed the sum of Likes , Shares and Comments are total engagement 
then total engagement divided by impressions to find out the engagement rate  

Then I created a pivot table to get average engagement per platform.
YouTube and Facebook came out on top.
Instagram was the lowest.

Next, I sorted engagement rate and pulled the top 10 posts.
Most high performers were Carousels and Reels from Twitter and YouTube.

Then I create another a pivot table for
Total Likes, Shares, and Comments by Content Type and Platform.
This showed Carousel and Video content gets the strongest response.

After that I moved clicks and hashtags to new sheet and separated hashtags where multiple hashtags are there , again I created a pivot table for
Average Clicks by Hashtag.

Here , ranking  #PepsiCoRefresh to highlight the top-performing hashtags.

ranking is numbered followed by #ThirstyForMore and #LiveForNow.
