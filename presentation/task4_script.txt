Task 4 : Hashtag & Content Strategy (16 Marks) 

First, I have taken Post ID and Hashtags Used from the cleaned data.

Then I separated multiple hashtags so that one hashtag is in one row.

After that, I created a pivot table using Hashtags and Post ID.

From this pivot table, the most frequently used hashtag is #PepsiCoRefresh.

Next, I took Post ID, Likes, Comments, and Hashtags Used from cleaned data.

Again, I separated hashtags so that each hashtag has its own row.

Then I created another pivot table using Hashtag, Likes, and Comments.
From this pivot table, Average performance of posts are 
#BetterWithPepsi and #SmoothLikeNitroPepsi.

Next, I took Platform, Content Type, Likes, and Comments from cleaned data. Then I created a pivot table using Content Type and Platform .
From this comparison, Carousels perform better than Images and Videos across platforms.

Using the same pivot table, I compared performance platform-wise.

From the analysis I recommend 
Facebook – Carousels and Reels perform better
Instagram – Images and Reels perform better
Twitter – Text and Carousels perform better
YouTube – Text and Story content perform better

So, content should be prioritized based on platform performance.
