Task 6: Follower Retention & Audience Loyalty (16 Marks) 

First, I created a new column for Net Follower Growth.

Then I created a pivot table using
Week_Start_Date, Platform, and Net Follower Growth.
This was saved as weekly_growth_pivot.

Using this pivot table, I created a line chart
to visualize weekly follower growth trends by platform.

based on the same pivot table , it states October is the highest net follower gain. 

Next, I performed 3-week moving average analysis
using continuous net follower growth values.

This was performed in moving_average_analysis.

Then I created a line chart using this data
to smooth out the follower growth trend.

After that 
I have created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship to Determine the correlation between ad spend and follower growth
Then I performed basic correlation calculation 

This shows how follower growth changes with ad spend.
