Platform Performance – Key Insights (Task 3)

Platform comparison shows that Instagram records the highest engagement rate among all platforms. This indicates stronger audience interaction and content resonance on Instagram compared to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

Follower growth analysis further supports this trend. Instagram demonstrates the highest net follower growth, showing that not only is engagement strong, but the platform is also expanding its audience faster than others.

The relationship between ad spend and engagement across platforms reveals that increased spending does not always guarantee proportional engagement growth. However, Instagram maintains higher engagement efficiency compared to other platforms.

Based on combined performance in:

engagement rate,

follower growth,

and consistent results from Facebook,

the data supports focusing on 1–2 core platforms: Instagram and Facebook.

Concentrating efforts on these platforms is likely to produce better returns than spreading resources across all platforms.
