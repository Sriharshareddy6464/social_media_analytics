Hashtag & Content Strategy – Key Insights (Task 4)

Hashtag frequency analysis shows that #PepsiCoRefresh is the most frequently used hashtag across posts. This indicates it is the primary branded tag being pushed in campaigns and content.

When evaluating average performance based on likes and comments, #BetterWithPepsi and #SmoothLikeNitroPepsi generate stronger audience response compared to other hashtags. This suggests these hashtags resonate more emotionally or contextually with the audience.

Content format comparison across platforms reveals that Carousels outperform both Images and Videos in overall engagement. This indicates that multi-frame, swipeable content holds user attention better than single-frame formats.

Platform-wise content effectiveness shows clear preferences:

Facebook performs better with Carousels and Reels

Instagram responds strongly to Images and Reels

Twitter performs better with Text and Carousels

YouTube shows better response to Text and Story-based content

This highlights that content strategy should be platform-specific rather than uniform.
Optimizing content type based on platform behavior is likely to improve overall engagement and performance.
